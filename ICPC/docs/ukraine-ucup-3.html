		<p>A: Rearrange letters in string $S$ such that every length $\ge 2$ prefix is not a palindrome.</p>
		<p>B: Find set $\{ \sum_i A_{i, \sigma_i} \mod 5 \mid \sigma \in S_n \}$.</p>
		<p>C: Pair up $2N$ students each with skill $S_i$, such that $|S_x - S_y| \le A$ for all pairs and number of pairs such that $|S_x - S_y| \le B$ is maximised.</p>
		<p>D: There are some books on $N$ desks. Move books minimally to clean all desks. </p>
		<p>E: Define two arrays $A, B$ almost equal if $\min \{ A_i, B_j \} = \min \{ A_j, B_i \} $. Count the number of almost-equal pairs $(A, B)$ where $|A| = |B| = N$ and $\max A, B \le M$.</p>
		<p>F: Count the number of binary partition of $N$ ($1 \le N \le 10^6$), such that cannot be split into two sets with same MSB after sum.</p>
		<p>G: Maximise length of longest common subsequence of $P \circ Q$ and $Q$ for a given permutation $P$. Cycles of functional graph.</p>
