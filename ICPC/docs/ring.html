<h1>Ring</h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>A ring can be seen as an extension of integers. Recall what a group $(G, \cdot)$ is, with operator $\cdot: G \times G \rightarrow G$ and $\cdot$ being associative, existence of unique identity and inverse. That simulates what we normally do with numbers with one operators. But how about both the $+$ and $\times$ operators, considered together? Hence the concept of ring is needed.</p>

<p>A ring in form of $(R, +, \cdot)$ has the following requirement:</p>
<ol>
	<li>$(R, +)$ is an abelian group (associative + identity + inverse + commutative).</li>
	<li>$(R, \times)$ is a monoid (associative + identity).</li>
	<li>$\times$ is distributive over $+$.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice that the restriction on $\times$ is actually much weaker compare to $+$, which can be explained by the fact that according to common sense, it is harder for $\times$ compare to $+$ to find inverse (fail case: $\mathbb{Z}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_n$ for any non-prime $n$) and for it to be commutative (fail case: matrix).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the conditions are strong enough for us to introduce "sensible" polynomial on ring. We denote $R[x]$ as the ring of polynomial in $x$ on ring $R$ in form of $\sum_{k = 0}^{n} a_k x^k$ with $a_k, x \in R$. Without distributivity, factorisation won't make sense at all - basically if we delete any other requirement, the situation just gets more chaotic! Luckily, normally no one dare propose task on crazy algebras. In fact, in accordance to normal definition of operations on polynomial, $R[x]$ is a ring as well!</p>

<p>Back to ring. On a ring $R$, we can consider the set $R^{\times}$ of elements with multiplicative inverse exists, which is closed under multiplication and hence $(R^\times, \times)$ forms a group. For example, $\mathbb{Z}_6^\times = \{1, 5\}$, $\mathbb{Z}^\times = \{1, -1\}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times = \mathbb{Z}_p \setminus \{ 0 \} $ for prime $p$.</p>

<p>The "version" of ring that we like the most is the field - when condition (2) is strengthen to be an abelian group. When this happens, every non-zero element of the ring has an inverse (division ring), and so the field $F$ has the multiplicative group $F^\times = F \setminus \{ 0 \}$. Essentially, for field we are allowed to do division $\frac{a}{b}$, except when of course $b = 0$. This is important property for some algorithms to work. An especially important case is $\mathbb{F}_p$, the finite field of size prime $p$.</p>
